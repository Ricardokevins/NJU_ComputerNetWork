Router extensions
-----------------

Here are three possible extensions to the router with exercise descriptions:

 * For a firewall extension:,see the ``firewall`` exercise folder.

 * For a RIPv2-like distance vector dynamic routing extension, see the ``dvroute`` folder.  

 * For a link state (OSPF-like) dynamic routing extension, see the ``lsroute`` folder.

Another idea, but without an exercise description:

  * Add a load balancing capability among 2 or more interfaces that are assumed to be connected to links leading to the same far-end destination (either to a single remote router or to multiple co-located routers).  You could create a hash function that uses packet header attributes as input to make a decision about which interface on which to forward the packet.
